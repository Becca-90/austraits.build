  sampling_strategy: Ten sites with Hakea species in abundance were selected along two gradients totalling 1300 km in southwestern Australia (Fig. 1). Fourteen sites with Proteaceae in abundance were selected along a less clearly defined gradient of 400 km in the western Cape of South Africa (Fig. 1). All site floras were evergreen and all species analysed were shrubs growing in the open. Sites were chosen to represent the range of annual rainfall in each region. In Australia, the average rainfall of the nearest town for 1985–94 was determined from records provided by the Bureau of Meteorology, Perth. At each site, all species present in the selected taxa were sampled, ranging from four to 16, with a mean of 10 in Australia. Species with very hairy leaves (two in all) were avoided as this was considered an alternative strategy to sclerophylly in conserving water. Where the sexes of dioecious species had distinctive foliage (some Leucadendron, Aulax) they were treated as separate species. At most sites, the species sampled occurred over an area of 100 ? 100 m, but in some flat areas (with negligible change in growing conditions) species were separated by up to 2 km. All sites were sampled in spring (September–November) from the previous season’s growth, that is, all leaves had passed through one summer’s drought. Flowering or fruiting branches were avoided, while only upper, sun-exposed branches were included.

  methodology_ids: All leaves were iso(bi)lateral and rarely possessed protruding midribs or petioles (which were excluded if they were prominent). Five to 20 branches from a total of five representative, mature plants per species were collected and placed in sealed plastic bags. Later that day, the thickness of the lamina at the longitudinal midpoint of one to two representative leaves per branch per plant were determined with vernier calipers. The transverse shape of needle leaves was noted for future correction of leaf volume. Avoiding mottled or damaged leaves, all previous season’s leaves were removed from their stems and bulked in equal proportions per plant. They were kept in rolled-up plastic bags for a further 1–2 days, then counted as they were placed diagonally on the conveyor belt (Li-Cor 3000, Lincoln, NK) or image plate (DIAS II, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) of an area meter. They were then placed in paper bags and dried at 60–70 °C for 2 days and bulked dry mass taken. However, area, mass and thickness for the hakea material were treated on an individual leaf basis. Leaf mass to area ratio (LMA) was determined, correcting for shape of the needle leaves (Witkowski & Lamont 1991). Dry leaf density (dry mass per volume) was determined from LMA divided by thickness (Witkowski & Lamont 1991).
