  description: Study investigating variation in key hydraulic and carbon economy traits
    of 12 woody species in Australia across a broad climatic gradient, using a common
    garden approach.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Plant material and experimental design ^p Twelve dominant tree
    species, representing five major woody vegetation types in NSW, Australia, were
    chosen for the present study (Table 1). Species vary markedly in climate-of-origin,
    with mean annual temperature (MAT) ranging from 10 to 20.5 °C and mean annual
    precipitation (MAP) ranging from 188 to 1,125 mm. Aridity index (AI), calculated
    as the ratio of MAP and potential evaporation, varies between 0.1 (most arid)
    for Acacia aneura and 1.1 (least arid) for Eucalyptus viminalis. Differences in
    climate-of-origin across species reflect differences in their native geographical
    distribution range (Figure S1). Rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest species
    are distributed along the eastern coastline of Australia, with the distribution
    of E. viminalis extending south to Tasmania. Semiarid woodland species occur in
    the drier inland areas, and A. aneura (mulga) has the widest distribution range
    of the 12 species, occurring across much of outback Australia. Seeds were obtained
    from Mount Annan Botanic Garden (Mount Annan, NSW, Australia, Table S2) and sown
    in forestry tubes in a sunlit polytunnel provided by Greening Australia (Richmond,
    NSW, Australia). On March 15, 2016, when seedlings were approximately 15 cm tall,
    plants were moved to the polytunnel facility of Western Sydney University (33o33′S,
    150o44′E, Richmond, NSW, Australia) and transplanted into 25-L bags filled with
    roughly 20 kg of loamy sand soil. The bags were isolated from the ground by palettes
    to prevent roots spreading beyond the pots. Each species was represented by 24
    individuals, with the exception of Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus macrorhyncha,
    which were represented by 17 and 18 individuals, respectively. All plants were
    fertilized 3 days after transplanting with soluble fertilizer and fertilized fortnightly
    until May 2016. Thereafter, plants were provided with commercial controlled release
    fertilizer (Osmocote, All purpose, Scotts, Australia) to ensure that they were
    not nutrient limited. All plants were watered for 10 min every other day using
    an irrigation system to maintain soil water content at field capacity. A randomized
    block design was adopted to minimize climatic variation in the polytunnel, which
    was divided into six blocks. Three or four plants of each species were randomly
    allocated to each block. Four individuals of each species were assigned to a well-watered
    treatment and were watered daily over the experimental period. The remaining individuals
    were assigned to a drought treatment. The unbalanced allocation of individuals
    to treatments enabled drought plants to be destructively sampled across a range
    of xylem water potentials during soil drying. Due to differences in growth rate
    between species, the drought treatment was applied separately to three groups
    of three to five species at different time periods. The drought treatment was
    implemented by withholding irrigation during two drought cycles. In the first
    drought cycle, plants were dried until leaves were visually wilting. Thereafter,
    irrigation resumed, and plants were watered daily for 10 days to allow full recovery.
    In the second drought cycle, irrigation was discontinued, and the plants were
    allowed to dry down. During this phase, leaf gas exchange characteristics and
    corresponding leaf water potential (Ψleaf, MPa) were measured periodically until
    positive net photosynthesis (Amax, μmol m−2 s−1) was no longer detectable. Photosynthetic
    photon flux density (PPFD, μmol m−2 s−1), air temperature (Tair, °C), and relative
    humidity (RH, %) were monitored in the polytunnel at 1.5 m height using a temperature/humidity
    probe (HMP60-L, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) and PPFD sensor (Decagon
    Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and were logged every 15 min with a data-logger
    (CR300, Campdell Scientific Inc.). Mean daily PPFD during the experimental period
    (i.e., December 2017 to May 2017) was 6.24 mol day−1. Average Tair and RH were
    20.2 °C and 65%, respectively.
