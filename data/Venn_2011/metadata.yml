  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted across seven snowpatches of the Main Range in the alpine area of Kosciuszko National Park, Snowy Mountains, south-eastern Australia. The region is characterized by continuous snow cover for up to 4 months of the year, with the first snowfalls of the season occurring between May and June. Snowcover in alpine areas may become discontinuous toward the end of October, although large drifts at high altitudes usually persist until mid November. Snowpatches on the lee side of the highest ridges can persist into February and occasionally later. Maximum snow depths from the nearby weekly-monitored snow course in Australia, Spencers Creek, 1,830 m, show high inter-annual variability, ranging between just over 360 cm (1981) and 85 cm (2006). However, snow depths in snowpatches can be up to 600 cm due to steep topography and snow drifting patterns (Costin et al. 2000). Temperatures in the Snowy Mountains vary considerably with the seasons; minimum temperatures can be below freezing for up to 6 months per year (Costin et al. 2000; Venn unpublished data), while maximum temperatures over winter occasionally reach 10–13 °C (Venn unpublished data). In the snow-free summer months, maximum temperatures can regularly reach 25 °C and overnight temperatures below 0 °C (Venn unpublished data). Vegetation types reflect the local topography, aspect, drainage, and duration of snow cover (Costin et al. 2000); bog and fen communities are in the lower drainage areas, shrublands on the slopes, tall and short alpine herbfield on the upper slopes and feldmark on the windswept rocky ridges (Costin et al. 2000). Highly organic alpine humus soil dominates on all bedrock types and under most physiographic conditions (Costin 1954; Good 1992). We collected trait data from 10 to 25 mature individuals of each species during the peak of the 2008/2009 growing season, in nearby locations in similar landscape positions. Trait data, including destructive sampling, were not directly measured from plants within the study plots. We measured three character-based traits (leaf area, plant height, seed mass) for the 40 species recorded in the quadrats across the seven snowpatches. We chose these traits based on the individual plant and ecosystem functions in which they are involved (Lepsˇ et al. 2006; Petchey and Gaston 2006) in the context of small-scale plant community dynamics. In addition, these traits are indicative of functional characteristics (Mason et al. 2003) and are also directly linked to ecosystem functioning.

  methodology_ids: We measured mean seed mass (lg) of all snowpatch species using seed freshly collected during the growing season of 2008/2009, stored seed, and seed associated with herbarium specimens. For species with very light seeds, 10 or 20 seeds were weighed at a time. Mean seed weight for each species was obtained from up to 25 replicate weights where enough seed was available.

Where fresh material was unavailable, we used herbarium specimens collected from the study region, housed in either the Kosciuszko Herbarium and the Australian National Herbarium; these specimens were photocopied or photographed with a scale, and leaf area was measured using a digital planimeter on enlarged, printed images.
