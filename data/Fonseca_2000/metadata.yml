  sampling_strategy: "SITE SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION Forty-six sites were chosen in relation to rainfall and geological criteria (Table 1). Sites were spread from east to west across the rainfall gradient. Within a rainfall zone (as defined in Table 2), sites were required to be either in a different geology (categories from 1:1000 000 Australian geological series maps, Geological Survey of NSW, Department of Mines) or, if in the same geology, then at least 30km apart. Efforts were made to locate sites both on rocks with high content of phosphorus and other nutrients (e.g. basalts) and on rocks with low phosphorus content (e.g. sand- stones). Sites that were clearly run-on or run-off were avoided. Soil water potentials were not measured because measurements over many years would have been necessary to obtain a long-term site aver- age, and in any event soil water potentials reflect water extraction by the vegetation as well as rainfall, whereas our aim was to use site descriptors that were independent of vegetation. Sites greater than 600m a.s.l. were avoided in order to stay within a modest temperature band (c. 15±18 _C mean annual temperature). For each locality, sites were selected where vegetation reflected species composition prior to habitat modification by people of European origin. At each site, five soil cores of 10-cm depth were collected and pooled. Subsamples were air-dried and ground to 0.2mm then digested with sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (Anderson & Ingram 1989). Total soil P was determined colourimetrically by an adaptation of Murphy & Ridley's (1967) single digestion method (Anderson & Ingram 1989). For each site an estimate of mean annual rainfall was obtained by interpolation between neighbouring rainfall stations with the use of the software ESOCLIM (CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Canberra). The database and interpolation algorithm is as described for the related software BIOCLIM (Hutchinson &Bischof 1983).  Total soil phosphorus was adopted as the indicator of soil nutrients at each site since (i) phosphorus is provided from the parent rock that characterizes the site, in contrast to nitrogen, which is substantially provided by nitrogen fixation (that is, by the vegetation itself); (ii) although only some soil phosphorus is readily available for plant growth and other short-term physiological processes, the total represents a pool of resource that has been available over the hundreds to thousands of years during which the present-day species mixture at the site has been assembled; (iii) other rock-derived nutrients, such as magnesium,are strongly correlated with phosphorus in rock, being influenced mainly by the proportion of nutrient-bearing minerals vs. quartz in the rock; and (iv) phosphorus is regarded as the most important single nutrient in shaping vegetation in temperate Australia (Beadle 1954; 1966).  FIELD SAMPLING  At each site, a single quadrat of 50_20m (0.1 ha) was surveyed with the aim of finding all vascular species apparent above-ground. Vouchers collected for subsequent identification are deposited in Macquarie University herbarium. Percentage canopy outline cover of each species within the plot was estimated by eye. The present paper reports results for perennials only. Ephemerals were excluded because it was not possible to sample them consistently (they were not growing at all sites at the time of visit). In addition, their traits would not relate to year-round rainfall in the same way as for perennials. (Nearly all perennials are evergreen within the study area). Epiphytes, parasites and vines were excluded on the basis that canopy height estimates do not reflect the same height-support trade-o€ as for self-supporting species. Also, para- sites like mistletoes do not pay the root-construction costs for supporting their transpiration needs."

  methodology_ids: Five leaves were collected and pressed for measurements of width, area and SLA. Leaves were taken from full-light situations and, where possible, from random branches on separate individuals (see Westoby 1998, appendix, for discussion of protocols for characterizing leaves and height). Leaf outline images were captured by HP DeskScan II scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) and quanti®ed by Delta-T SCAN image analysis software (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). No information given on protocol for determining mass.
