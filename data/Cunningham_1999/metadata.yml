  sampling_strategy: All species used are evergreen, perennial plants naturally occurring in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia. Collections were made between latitudes 308309 and 368309 S (Appendix A). We selected species according to the habitat that they successfully occupied, as determined first from their known distributions. Selection was then refined after site-specific data were collected. For the nutrient contrasts, we selected a set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from low-nutrient soils and the other from higher nutrient soils, all within the coastal (higher rainfall) region of NSW. The distribution of species with regard to soil nutrients was judged initially from the literature. In many cases, field guides explicitly state preferred soils. In some instances, preferred soils were judged from preferred habitat; e.g., plants in heaths or in open eucalypt forests were judged to be distributed on lower nutrient soils, and those found in or near rain forest were judged to prefer richer soils. For rainfall contrasts, we selected a different set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from the low rainfall western plains of NSW, and one species from the higher rainfall coastal region of eastern NSW. This eastâ€“west contrast provides a gradient in total rainfall, while keeping the seasonal pattern similar. We did not use species with distributions that encompassed both the coastal plain and the western plain, although some eastern species also occurred on the western slopes of the dividing range. Among the eastern species, we did not choose species found mainly on high-nutrient soils. Species pairs were chosen to form phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Within the two sets of comparisons (the rainfall set and the soil nutrient set), each species pair shared a common ancestor different from the common ancestor of any other species pair in the set. Thus, each species pair represented a separate evolutionary divergence. Most PICs were species within genera; some contrasts were chosen at higher taxonomic levels, in case evolutionary divergences were apparent only in contrasts with a longer time since divergence.

  questions for austraits: should site data include rainfall, %P from appendix; also lots of other traits in the appendix -why aren't these in austraits?

  methods: This sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of field collection and was vacuum-dried before chemical analyses (in the laboratory of I. D. Hume, University of Sydney, for all but alkaloids).Total nitrogen concentration of leaves was determined by semimicro Kjeldahl digestion, with selenium as a catalyst (Ivan et al. 1974).
