# leaf_width_max & leaf_width_min

Problems are coming from the scraped datasets where conversions aren't being done properly
- e.g. Acacia bakeri
- most issues with dataset_092 and dataset_093

# plant_height_min
- Discrepancies between 112 and 114. 112 appears to be correct (e.g. Abutilon cryptopetalum, 112 min height is 0.25m, 114 is 5m (actually 500cm)) although see Haemodorum planifolium (0.3 vs 0.6) and Iphigenia indica (0.2 vs 0.4)
- Problems again with datasets 092 and 093. E.g. Allocasuarina grevilleoides, which is described as 0.14-0.4m in Wikipedia
	- dataset_093 has min height at 15 m.

# plant_height_max	
- Still some strange stuff going on with 112 and 114 
	- e.g. Baumea rubiginosa 0.19/4m 114/112 but see Brunonia australis 0.4/0.3 112/114
- 93 is ever wrong, lots and lots of whacky values coming out of here
- everything else looks pretty OK

# leaf_length_max & leaf_length_min
- the strangeness is brought by 92 and 93 E.g. (leaf_length_max) Haemodorum spicatum, raw data says 3mm, converted to 30mm. Value from dataset_055 is 700mm, which appears to be correct according to online descriptions.
- everything else looks allG

###### seed_mass ######
- 0 values accounting for quite a few Inf ranges (0 values indicate NA)
- some 057_D values are too low 
	- e.g. Acaena novae-zelandiae (57D - 0.06mg, 57B - 4.17); Acaena ovina (57D - 0.03, 53 - 10.33) 
- 053 also has some quack numbers. Agonis flexulosa - 0.3956, 119.07; Banksia armata - 120.128, 8.6532
- need to go through this with Rach, it's dodgy as.

# specific_leaf_area
- dataset_038 SLA values are 10fold too - should be in mg/cm2 rather than g/m2
- this still doesn't all issues though. There appear to be some very high SLA values in here, and it may have something to do with the data coming from glasshouse studies. 
	- these are seedlings in glasshouse, make sure this is mentioned in metadata
- most species look pretty good, couple of outlandish values e.g. Exocarpos cupressiformis
- some high values are from alpine spp. but need to do a prune for excessively high valuess.

##### leaf_area #####
- gonna have problems with (bi)pinnate Acacias, depending on what the unit of measurement is
	- 	e.g. Acacia dealbata. 118 and 32 have 227 and 230mm2 respectively, other datasets such as 39, 73, 61 have 4, 3.3, 2.6, 3.3 mm
	- although see Acacia myrtifolia (big old phyllodes). dataset_064 has 20mm2 while _039 has 222mm2.
	- Acacia terminalis has 25.3mm2 in datasets 61 and 73, but 5289mm2 in 117. 
- ferns aswell e.g. Blechnum cartilagineum
- lots of suspected errors e.g. Brachyscome curvicarpa, 4mm2 in dataset_107 vs 48.3 in dataset_008. What to do?
- LEAF AREA RECORDS ARE STRONGLY DIVERGENT AND A LOT OF THIS IS PROBABLY REAL
- remove dataset 006_F as values are from flora anyways

# leaf_dry_mass
- not worth looking into too much atm

# leaf_delta15N
- some substantial intraspecific variation but a lot of it is within datasets so, ok

# plant_height
- this one's going to be difficult because it's not maximum plant height.
