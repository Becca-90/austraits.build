DATA CHECKING

LEAF AREA:

	dataset_006_F
		- rainforest spp.

	dataset_032
		- data are fine, actually normal rather than log normal

	dataset_039
		- data are in cm2 not mm2 (need *1000)
		- Acacia melanoxylon, Banksia marginata and Bursaria spinosa checked
		- changed metadata.yml to reflect required changes

	## dataset_040
		- Eucalyptus crebra leaf area is way too small
		- Melaleuca viridifolia leaf area at the extreme low end according to online info
		- Eucalyptus miniata also at extreme low end according to online info
		- Eucalyptus shirleyi at low end according to online info
	## dataset_041 same provenance

	dataset_045
		- Alphitonia excelsa & Corymbia citriodora checked, all G

	dataset_063
		- Eucalyptus tetrodonta, Melaleuca viridiflora checked all G

	dataset_115
		- high values, rainforest spp.
		- Neolitsea dealbata checked, all G

SPECIFIC LEAF AREA:

###	dataset_038
	#	- Rach glasshouse acacia data
	#	- units in g/m2 (LMA)
	#	- original data are too low by factor of 10, not sure what units are
	#	- Acacia floribunda: original value is 7.63. 1/7.63*1000 = 131.1 (should be in range of 13.1) https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=7.63+g%2Fm2+in+mm2%2Fmg
		-FIXED (just changed it to mm2/mg, it wasn't in LMA units to start with...)

	dataset_057_B,D,E,H,I,J
		- all G, had units of mg/mm2 instead of mm2/mg (which was correct)
###		- a few retarded values, which are duplicated in dataset_072

	dataset_070
		- kind of low, but all Hakeas and Proteaceae

	dataset_072
		- alpine herb fields so some high SLAs
		- Diplaspis nivis is way wrong (too high)
		- checked Carex gaudichaudiana, similar value to dataset_057_J

	dataset_109
		- units were in mm2/g, data would be correct if in mm2/mg
		- changed to mm2/mg

	dataset_117
		- units are mm2/mg but described as LMA. Data looks correct if changed to mg/mm2 ####DID I CHANGE THIS?######
		- Acacia suaveolens, Banksia serrata checked, allG


LEAF THICKNESS:

	dataset_018
		- data are in um not mm, checked Hakea brownii, Banksia serrata
		- changed units to um
		- added um/mm conversion

	dataset_032
		- units recorded as microns, should be mm
		- checked Banksia marginata
		- changed units to mm


LEAF_N_PER_DRY_MASS
	
###	dataset_032
		- Warrental2006 values (under site_name) seems to be 10x too high
		- checked Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus regnans
		- ASK IF CORRECT IN EMAIL

	dataset_062
		- seems to be out by 1000 - ug/g rather than mg/g
		- no species to compare with but checked against avg. acacia values
		- original units were '(microg g^-1)''
		- changed units to ug/g


SEED MASS:

A number of species have values of 0 in datasets 010, 027, 107

	dataset_057_D
		- some v. small values
		- checked Crassula sieberiana, Wahlenbergia communis, allG


LEAF_N_PER_AREA

	dataset_040
		- units are wrong, data are actually correct for g/m2 not mg/cm2
		- no spp. to compare but compared acacia values
		- changed units to mg/m2
	dataset_041
		- same as above

LEAF_P_PER_AREA & LEAF_K_PER_AREA
	
	- same as LEAF_N_PER_AREA


LEAF_MASS_PER_AREA

	- changed 16,21,32,39,45


LEAF_WATER_CONTENT_PER_MASS

###	- need to standardise


### PLANT_HEIGHT_MAX ###

	- Unit conversion appears broken where multiple units exist within a dataset
	- e.g. dataset_093, e.g Haemodorum spicatum value in raw data is 200 with units cm. Remains at 200 with units m in processed data. - SHOULD BE FIXED, NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK


WOOD DENSITY
	
	dataset_020
### - Persoonia linearis datapoint out by 10
	- FIXED

LEAF_DRY_MATTER_CONTENT

	dataset_57_E
		- initial units were in mg/g rather than %
		- changed to %

	dataset_57_J #### DELETE ####
	###	- lots of suscpiciously low values (below 0.05)
		- I call bullshit.
		- these values are duplicated in dataset_072

LEAF_K_PER_DRY_MASS

	dataset_032
		- wide distribution, checked and looks fine, no order of magnitude issues


PHOTOSYNTHETIC_RATE_PER_DRY_MASS
	- unit conversion from nmolCO2/s/g to mmolCO2/s/g was x*1000
	- changed to x*0.001
	- should sort out datasets 32, 40, 41, 63, 65, 66, 69

PHOTOSYNTHETIC_RATE_PER_AREA
	- units for dataset_073 still missing


STOMATAL_CONDUCTANCE_PER_AREA
	
	dataset_040, dataset_041
		- units were unclear from original data, set to umolH20
		- changed to mmolH20

### LEAF_DELTA13C ###
- couldn't plot because negative number <- NaNs


### LEAF_WIDTH_MAX & LEAF_WIDTH_MIN ###
- lots of data, hard to tease apart
- dataset_114 is shifted and 093 might have issues similar to problems with plant_height_max
- NEEDS CHECKING

LEAF_DARK_RESPIRATION_PER_DRY_MASS
- ugh, I don't know what these values should be
- send to Rach, who will send to Ian
- SENT TO IAN, NEEDS UPDATING
